# Heart-Disease-Prediction-model

I used several machine learning models to predict that there is a heart disease or not , based on 13 features.

Features:
1)age
2)sex
3)chest pain type (4 values)
4)resting blood pressure
5)serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6)fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7)resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8)maximum heart rate achieved
9)exercise induced angina
10)oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11)the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12)number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13)thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect


Run the app.py file and then go to this link : http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to run the model on the website .
